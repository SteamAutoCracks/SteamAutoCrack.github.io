<a href="/docs/" class="btn btn-primary">Back</a>  

## Download  

You can download the latest version from GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/SteamAutoCracks/Steam-auto-crack/releases/latest).  

## Crack Process  

1. Run **Steam Auto Crack**. (If it doesnâ€™t start, see [Troubleshoot: Q2](/docs/FAQ#troubleshoot))  
2. Ensure **Options 1-4** are checked. (They are checked by default)  
3. Select the **Path** using `...`, or drag & drop files into the textbox.  
4. Click **Start Crack**, then locate the **Steam App ID** using `App ID Finder`.  
5. Wait for the crack process to complete. (Logs will be displayed in the `Log` window)  

## Extra Notes  

1. You must have **clean Steam game files** to perform the crack.  
2. The game must use only **normal Steam API checks and SteamStub DRM**. This tool **will not work** on other DRM protections like **Denuvo, VMProtect, etc.**  
3. The **App ID Finder** may take longer to load when used for the first time.
