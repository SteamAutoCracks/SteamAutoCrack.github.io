# User Manual

## Main Options

### Path

* Set the Steam clean game file folder (Make sure to choose the root game path, for example in UE4 games you should choose the folder that includes the `Engine` folder), game executable or steam_api(64).dll.

### Steam App ID

* Set the Steam App ID.

* SteamKit2 Client: Use SteamKit2 Client for generating most of the info and Steam Web API/Xan105 API for game schema. (Best result)
* Steam Web API: Steam Web API/Xan105 API for all game info. (Faster but less info)
* Offline: Generate offline basic info without Internet.

### Use Xan105 API

* Use Xan105 API to replace Steam Web API, but can't generate stats. (Currently not working)
